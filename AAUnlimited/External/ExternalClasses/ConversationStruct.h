 *
 * Each of these subclasses start with a virtual table, whose second entry is the offset from this class
 * to the sub-struct. there are 13 of these subclasses,
 * at 0, C, 20, 286C, 2874, 287C, 2890, 2894, 289C, 28A4, 28AC, 28B8, 28C4, respectively.
 * ConversationSubStruct + 0x839C holds an integer that determines which of these substructs is to be used
 * for the last call (by the position in the above list).
 * 0: player talks to someone
 * 1: npc talks to player
 * 3: after h
 * 9: fight

 * All of these classes, no matter which, has a ConversationSubStruct that saves vital information.
