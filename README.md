## Features:
For a full list of features, please read [this page](https://github.com/aa2g/AA2Unlimited/wiki/).

### Gameplay enhancement:
- **Poser**: You can pose characters. You have complete control of the scene which includes every part of the body, objects, rooms, and lighting. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/QW93buB) are some examples of the poser in action.
- **Modules**: You can create custom traits and make changes to the AI of your characters. List of pre-made traits can be found [here.](https://github.com/aa2g/AA2Unlimited/wiki/Module-list)
- **H-Ai**: When a player is being raped, the player will not be in control of the sex scene. The NPC's Ai will be picking the positions, and the scene will last until they are satisfied. The player cannot say no to rape if they have the exploitable trait. When you spectate two NPCs who are publicly fucking, an H scene will start with H-Ai turned on.

### Character editor enhancement:
- **Unlocks** - We've made the character editor significantly more powerful. We've added the option to set custom shadows, custom outlines, highlights and textures. Unlocked previously locked sliders and added new sliders to the body and face.
- **Overrides and redirects** - Allows loading arbitrary assets from disk. This makes it possible to use any number of character mods without conflicts.
- **Custom tans** - Unlimited amount of colored tans.

### Fixes & General
- **Vanilla game fixes** - We fix various drivers issues, as well as make it possible to run AA2 on newer systems (Windows 10, Linux). We've also fixed all Japanese locale issues. Allows to play in borderless fullscreen. We include dgVoodoo 2 ([website](http://dege.fw.hu)) as an alternative d3d9 fix for Windows systems.
- **Asset embedding** - A system of embedding mods into cards themselves and auto extraction for the ease of sharing.
- **Mod compression** - We've gathered the most essential mods and compressed them into the ppex/pp2 format. You install mods by drag and dropping them, there is no need for Illusion Wizzard.
- **Various additions** - Unlocked homosexual sex scenes, added a subtitle overlay, built-in graphics settings, etc.
