# AA2Unlimited
AAFace was supposed to make the Maker do things that it already could, but wouldn't want to. 
It basically gave a UI to these features.

AAUnlimited, on the other hand, tries to make the game (and maker) do new things.

As a part of this, it puts additional Information into the card images in form of a PNG chunk right before the first IEND chunk. The Game treats these as part of the image, which means cards produced with these additional data will still work normally if used without AAUnlimited. However, it also means that saving the card with a normal Maker will remove this data. Latest AA2Snowflake is aware of this data so you can use it to change card face without losing it. Because AAU data is attached to the card face it can be moved around with ReiEdit's import feature.

## Features:

### Gameplay changes:
- **H-Ai**: AI that does H for you. Activates when the player is forced or at evil no prompt h.
	- NO means YES when forced by an npc
- **Position Buttons during H** are aligned in rows if there are too many buttons per category, allowing to add more buttons before they go out of the screen
- **POV**: in H-Mode press `Q` to switch between POVs of participants. Press `W` to restore to normal view and center on the chest bone.
- **Poser**: in clothing menu, frames can be rotated. Sliders are defined in poserframes.txt. Poses can be saved and loaded.

### General:
- **Shadow Files**: Instead of only loading files from a .pp file, the game checks for a folder of the same name (without the pp ending) first. If this folder exists and contains a file of the required name, this file is loaded instead.
   - **Shadowing Sets**: grouped and isolated sets of shadow files. A folder called *sets* next to the pp files(works for both *AA2Play* and *AA2Edit*) can define shadowing sets. Each subfolder, if its name starts with a `!`, can contain folders with the name of a pp file to shadow in the same way as normal shadowing works. Example:
```
data
├ jg2e01_00_00
│ └ A00_10_00_00.xx			| Shadow file. Will replace face 10 from original pp
└ sets
  ├ !myActiveSet
  │ └ jg2e01_00_00
  │   └A00_20_00_00.xx			| Shadow set. Will replace face 20 from original pp
  └ myPassiveSet
    └ jg2e01_00_00
      └ A00_10_00_00.xx			| Shadow set. Will do nothing because set is disabled
```

### Card Data: adds additional card data to cards:
- **Tan**: Uses a tan from *AAEdit\data\override\tan*. The folder is expected to have the same format used for [Tantoo](http://www.hongfire.com/forum/forum/hentai-lair/hf-modding-translation/artificial-academy-2-mods/409828-skin-cum-tan-nipples-lips-manager-pack-aa2tantoo) (just copy its tan folder over). [Hight pixel density skin](https://mega.nz/#F!IVFyWIrb!meEOFx8i7nHDYMHOAQL2Kg) is highly recommended (see [Issue #40](https://github.com/aa2g/AA2Unlimited/issues/40))
- **Hair Highlight**: Use a hair highlight from *AAEdit\data\override\hair_highlight*. *Note*: effectively the same as **Mesh Override** `(Asp00_20_00_00_00\*)->(file)`, so this will not work if you have custom highlights without this name prefix

These Features above are all simply special, wild-carded rules of one of the types below. While the rules below do NOT support wild cards naturally, all of these things could be done for specific slots or files using the rules directly. Whenever a High-Poly model is loaded (or all the time in AAEdit), these rules from the corresponding card are applied. The following generic rule types exist:
- **Mesh Texture Overrides**: A set of rules of the form `(TextureName)->(TextureFileOnHarddrive)`. Whenever a xx file is loaded that contains a texture of a given name, a different texture from the file system is loaded instead
- **Archive Overrides**: A set of rules of the form `(archive.pp|file)->(fileOnHarddrive)`. Whenever a given file is read from a given archive, a different file from the harddrive will be loaded instead.
- **Archive Redirects**: A set of rules of the form `(archive.pp|file)->(archive.pp|file)`. Whenever a given file is read from a given archive, a different file from a different archive is loaded instead.
- **Object Overrides**:  A set of rules of the form `(ObjectName)->(file)`. Whenever a xx file is loaded that contains the given Object, it is replaced by the object in the given xxo file. The format of the given file must be exactly how it is stored inside the xx file. There is a different exe in this project that can extract those: `XXObjectExtracter`. *Note*: by the looks of it, the file is radically different depending on the xx file version. These overrides probably only work for xx files version 8.
  
### Additional card based features:
- **Save Override Files**: all files target by these overrides, can be saved inside the card; if such a card is opened or previewed in the editor, the files will be extracted automatically if they're missing.
- **Eye Textures**: a seperate texture can be used for the right eye
- **Body Sliders**: additional sliders for certain body parts
- **Outline Color**: can change outline color for this character (every part of the body)
- **Tan Color**: can change the tan color from its brown shade
- **Additional Hairs**: more hairs than the original 4 can be added. Note that these hairs do not have low poly modles (yet)
- **Body Modification**: can put an SRT(*S*cale *R*otation *T*ranslation) matrix in front of frames or modify the SRT matrix of bones. Essentially generic body(or hair, or outfit, or anything) sliders. Only use if you are aware of how AA2 handles bodies.
  - *Note*: due to how AA2 handles frames, this is not the same as changing a frame in SB3U. rotations and scales will affect the original matrix of this frame. Adjust your matrix accordingly to make up for the incorrect translations.
